## 🚀 Project Kickoff – Act 1: The Premise

### ❓ Problem

Running quantized LLMs locally is increasingly popular — but not every prompt requires the same level of precision or compute.  
Using a high-precision (e.g., Q8) model for a casual summary is wasteful, while using a low-precision (e.g., Q2) model for code generation might lead to poor results.

> Most local LLM workflows treat every prompt the same.

### 💡 Solution

**SeAQuEn** (Self-Adaptive Quantization Engine) dynamically routes user prompts to the most suitable quantization level of a model (Q2, Q4, Q8) by analyzing:

- 🧠 The **prompt complexity**
- 🌡️ **System status** like CPU temperature and RAM usage
- ⚙️ Runtime conditions such as load and context length

The goal is to **optimize performance without compromising quality**.

### 🧱 Architecture Overview

- `FastAPI` backend for handling prompt requests  
- Modular runners for each quantized model version (`Q2`, `Q4`, `Q8`)  
- A `prompt_analyzer` to estimate input complexity  
- A `system_monitor` to track hardware state in real time  
- Structured logging and tests for observability and reliability

### 🎯 Why This Matters

Local LLMs are resource-constrained. This project explores how we can make them smarter —  
automatically adjusting performance based on real-world input and system feedback.

By combining quantization, adaptive routing, and modular infrastructure, **SeAQuEn** is designed to serve as a foundational building block for efficient on-device LLM inference.
